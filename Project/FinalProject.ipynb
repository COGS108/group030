    "The question our group is trying to answer is: <b>What factors contribute to the types of crime committed in Los Angeles within a specific area throughout the day/night?</b> We also want to address what a data driven response would look like. One specific example we want to look into is whether street light coverage or a greater police presence contribute to lower overall crime rates in neighborhoods at night. We will use this data to consider whether moving police patrols to areas with less streetlight coverage would lead to a reduction in crime."

    "The datasets that we’re planning on using consist of streetlight data for the city of Los Angeles in combination with as much police data we can gather on locations where officers are called, the types of crimes committed, data on arrests made, and where officers stop people consistently. These datasets used together will help lead us to a more holistic view of the situation we are trying to analyze. Each of the datasets doesn’t necessarily hold all of the data the others do in a homogenous way (i.e. some are missing years) but by increasing the amount of datasets we use and inferring connections based off of the data present, a clear picture will be painted and our call to action on what practices need to be put in place to increase the safety of Los Angeles will be backed up by valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting our exploratory data analysis of datasets we found on the subject, we don’t know a lot about the topic besides the inherent feeling of safety one gets when you’re in an area with street lights compared to a dark street. So our starting hypothesis is mainly based off of intuition and personal experience. The datasets we’ve found so far have a lot of information within them besides just location data, so we’ll have a very wide view of this narrow topic which we’ll be able to continually narrow our scope to reveal interesting answers and insightful conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We weren’t able to find any other projects asking questions about the correlation between streetlights and police officer patrol locations. Our project seems to be fairly unique in the intersectionality of the data we’re using to reveal interesting insights into public safety. However, there have been projects created about streetlights and their affects on the number of crimes per year. An example of this is the report by Kinder Rice Institute for Urban Research that goes into how it was very difficult to recommend that cities increase streetlights to directly combat crime. Hopefully our project is able to contribute to the public good of Los Angeles by discovering ways to increase the city's safety without increasing costs for taxpayers.\n",
